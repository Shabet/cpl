The qsort() function is a modified partition-exchange sort, or quicksort.
The heapsort() function is a modified selection sort.  The mergesort()
function is a modified merge sort with exponential search intended for
sorting data with pre-existing order.

The qsort() and heapsort() functions sort an array of nmemb objects, the
initial member of which is pointed to by base.  The size of each object
is specified by size.  mergesort() behaves similarly, but requires that
size be greater than ``sizeof(void *) / 2''.

The contents of the array base are sorted in ascending order according to
a comparison function pointed to by compar, which requires two arguments
pointing to the objects being compared.

The comparison function must return an integer less than, equal to, or
greater than zero if the first argument is considered to be respectively
less than, equal to, or greater than the second.
